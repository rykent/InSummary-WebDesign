		<h1>Skills I now have</h1>

		<p>Over the course of this year this class helped me develop many skills. Some of them such as resume writing and job finding I don't think I would've thought about unless I took this class.<br>Some of the skills I have learned are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Writing a resume</li>
			<li>Using different job finding websites to search for jobs</li>
			<li>Use html and css to create websites and style them</li>
			<li>Make a github repo and have multiple people contributing it.</li>
			<li>Use github pages to host a website</li>
		</ul>

		<p>There was a lot of things that I learned in this class that I think will be helpful later on in my life.</p>
