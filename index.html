		<h1>Summary of Web Design Intersession</h1>

		<p>Overall, this class ended up being a lot better than I expected. I'm really glad that the design thinking stuff wasn't forced on us like other classes. Also, I felt like the skills I learned in this class could actually be useful later on.</p>
		<p><br>I hope that I do end up using many of the skills that I learned in this class because the topic of web design is interesting to me. The class was great and I progessed a lot in my knowledge of css, html, javascript, and job finding.</p>
