		<h1>Skills I Had Before This Class</h1>

		<p>Before taking the Web Design intersession class I didn't really know much about web design. I knew a few of the basics but the main reason I took this class was to learn how to do web design.<br>Some of the skills I had before:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Knew some basic javascript and other coding languages</li>
			<li>Had used inspect element to change stuff on pages</li>
			<li>Knew how to use github to make repos</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Overall, there was many web design skills that I was lacking and wished to learn.</p>
